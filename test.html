      When considering what to create for a <a class="link dim dark-gray underline"
      href="https://www.codelouisville.org/">Code Louisville</a> front-end project, my first idea
      was to make something about cats. But, I decided to go with my second idea: create something
      informative about front-end development. As a topic I wanted to share Functional CSS. But I
      suck at writing and after coming across <a class="link dim dark-gray underline"
      href="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tachyons/issues/13">this</a>, I decided to <em>show</em>
      rather than <em>tell</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy tj center dark-gray">
      For my project I recreated a <a class="link dim dark-gray underline"
      href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> blog post using the amazing <a
      class="link dim dark-gray underline" href="http://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a> css toolkit. The
      article is "<a href="http://mrmrs.github.io/writing/2016/03/24/scalable-css/"
      class="link dim dark-gray underline">Css and Scalability</a>" written by
      <a href="http://mrmrs.cc/" class="link dim dark-gray underline">Adam Morse</a> (the creator of
      Tachyons himself!) in 2016. It was his article that first introduced me to Functional/Atomic
      CSS. With Tachyons, when I'm designing UI for a page or project I actually get to spend that
      time <em>designing</em>, and not figuring out how to design.

        Several years ago I got curious about how css worked at scale. When I first started out,
        there weren’t nearly as many learning resources as there are now. There were a few books
        that my friends lent me and a couple of decent blog posts. But css was still pretty new and
        most people hadn't started to think deeply or learn hard lessons about concepts of
        maintainability when working with teams on large web apps.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Css zen garden was a highly influential demo '<em>back in the day</em>.' Most of my
        colleagues and I thought this did a perfect job at illustrating the power of the cascade.
        You could drastically alter a site's visual design without touching even a bit of html.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        In the beginning, that’s what people sold me as a feature. By writing css, you could make a
        change in one place and have it propagate everywhere. In principle this sounds highly
        desirable. But eleven years later, my experience on both large and small teams is that this
        is the most terrifying thing about css and can cripple an organizations ability to iterate
        on their product.

        After countless implementations of css systems that broke down and became difficult to
        maintain as apps and teams grew larger... I've found I want little to no part of the
        cascade's 'features.'
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        I used to joke that the worst part about front-end development was that the other people
        solving your problems were front-end developers. But in the past few years a lot of very
        smart people have been thinking more about css and this has lead to some fascinating
        discussions around how to build ‘scalable’ ui and how that relates to css. When I first
        started to think about scalability I naturally started to read every blog post and watch
        every tech talk I could get my hands on. There are a number of suggested 'best practices'
        around how sass/less/stylus etc. will help you build maintainable css. How mixins can make
        your code more <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>. How extends will keep your
        markup clean and pretty to look at. How <abbr title="Block Element Modifier">BEM</abbr> will
        make your code so perfect you want to cry.

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        But what is reality? What actually gets shipped to production? What do all of these tips and
        tricks do to our production css? How does it affect the whole team? More important, how are
        your end users affected?
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        When it comes to designing and shipping products I like to think about reality. Which can be
        challenging sometimes. I’ve sat in too many meetings where people don't want to hear or talk
        about reality. They talk in empty phrases about hypothetical possibilities. I like to do
        drugs and talk like that too sometimes. But, if you don't accurately assess where you
        currently are and what your reality is, it can be pretty tough to figure out what your
        problems are. And the chance of finding solutions to unidentified problems is, well, not
        good.

        So there I was, in the fall of 2014, a new employee at an

          class="link dim underline black-80">award winning tech company
        </a> that had a website. And that website had a lot of css. Wanting to familiarize myself
        with the codebase - I opened up dev tools and started to read the site's css.

        Some of the code made me laugh:

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Eventually, I stumbled across this class of code.
      </p>

      <figure type="snippet" class="css bg-light-gray nl3 nr3 mh4-l"></figure>

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        I saw this class and thought - well at least you know what it does. Unlike some of the other
        css it seemed like it was very reusable. By anyone who needed to float something left.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        I kept reading and stumbled across this:
      </p>

      <figure type="snippet" class="css bg-light-gray nl3 nr3 mh4-l"></figure>

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        …followed by this very similar block of code…
      </p>

      <figure type="snippet" class="css bg-light-gray nl3 nr3 mh4-l"></figure>

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        I found myself wondering what the story was behind this next code block. Is it for elements
        with the class <code>.header-nav-list</code> that aren’t nested inside an element with the
        class <code>.header-nav-container</code>?
      </p>

      <figure type="snippet" class="css bg-light-gray nl3 nr3 mh4-l"></figure>

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Here we start to see a mixture of content-semantic (<code>.submenu</code>) with visually
        semantic class names (-3col).
      </p>

      <figure type="snippet" class="css bg-light-gray nl3 nr3 mh4-l"></figure>

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Css is interesting because unlike other types of code, you are most likely to find the most
        recent code towards the bottom of the file. Reading a css file from start to finish will
        often times reveal in chronological order how a defined system breaks down.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        In the above examples we see things breaking down to increasingly longer selectors that have
        more and more weight that were only setting one property to one value: <code>float:
        left</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Mind you, there are only three options for float. Contrary to one of the code examples
        above, there is no float center. Just left, right, and none.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Reading the css made me think about a lot of things. One thing I couldn’t get out of my head
        was - why all this work to change one thing? Why write all that code to just float something
        left?
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        To me, this is a reflection of the mental model most people are in when they are writing
        front-end code. They are generally trying to change one or two things in an interface and
        that’s it. And when you are in this mode of development you want to limit the amount of
        things you break - while also making the change that is being asked for in some Jira ticket
        that got assigned to you.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        I also started to think about communication and how it moves in multiple directions. If I’m
        reading html, I want to know what the css is going to do. If I’m reading css I want to know
        what will happen if I apply it to a block of html. In a great system there is a two way
        street of information. If you look at the css, you can tell what will happen. If you look at
        the html, you know what the code will do.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        But most front-end systems are not great. You have what I refer to as one-way streets of
        information. If I am looking at a block of html and I can’t find ALL of the css that will
        visually affect how it renders in under 5 seconds, I feel that system is failing. So if I
        ran into the above example:
      </p>

      <figure type="snippet" class="css bg-light-gray nl3 nr3 mh4-l"></figure>

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        That means I would have to find elements that had both of those classes (but not limited to)
        on an element. But by looking at this block of css I also have no idea if it has been
        redefined elsewhere. So I must grep through the system to find definitions for
        container-inner and promo-status. By the time I found those definitions - I would probably
        have forgotten what I was trying to do in which case I’d leave my desk and go get coffee.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        On the flip side think about this example:
      </p>

      <figure type="snippet" class="css bg-light-gray nl3 nr3 mh4-l"></figure>

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        I’d presume that this would make an element have red text. I was traditionally told this is
        a horrible name for a class. But I quite like it. The only way I’d think it was bad is if it
        set the color property to: purple, blue, or any other color that wasn’t red. Or if it was
        mutated a few times to a few different shades of red. But more on that later.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        And if I saw this block of html:
      </p>

      <figure type="snippet" class="html bg-light-gray nl3 nr3 mh4-l"></figure>

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        I’d know without looking at the css what was going to happen. This is what I call a two-way
        street of information. It’s easy to learn a group of small classes that do one thing well
        and can be reused in any context. There should be a one to one mapping between a class and
        it’s definition. Having a class that has multiple definitions be being redefined depending
        on context doesn’t solve problems, it creates them. The concept of immutability is not new -
        but we’ve ignored it in the css community for far too long. Imagine if you had a function
        called ‘filesize’ where you passed it a filename and it returned the filesize. That sounds
        pretty great. But imagine if sometimes it returned the amount of lines in the file. That
        doesn’t sound great at all does it. Well that’s what you’re doing anytime you redefine a css
        class. It’s the worst for people who are good at debugging css. It’s even more horrible for
        people new to the cascade.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        When we look at convoluted css, we must remember that behind every css ruleset is a story.
        Maybe the author was on a time crunch and didn’t have time to look up if there was some
        previously written code they could reuse. Maybe they don’t care about css at all and the
        second something works they save, commit, and go back to writing monads. When I write bad
        code, it isn’t because I’m not trying to write good code. There are always other forces at
        work. What are the forces that work against writing clean reusable code? How do we get rid
        of them? I’ve spent the last few years doing a lot of user testing centered around how
        people write their own front-end code, consume other peoples front-end code, and think about
        developing UI in general. It has been a pretty valuable experience (as user-testing
        generally is). I’ve learned a lot about the different mental models people use - and how to
        try to construct systems that allow people of all abilities to spend more time designing /
        building and less time debugging/fighting/crying.

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Before I started doing both performance and user testing I did not like the idea of
        oocss/atomic css. I really liked writing monolithic classes and traversing the dom with my
        selectors. It made a ton of sense to me and I was able to build out a lot of websites that
        way. Running tests and testing my assumptions helped inform a lot of how I think about code
        now. I’m not very interested in what I can do with css. I’m interested at this point in what
        I can help groups of people do with css.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        If you’re going to build a new component, or change a piece of UI in your app - what do you
        do? I don’t know anyone that reads all the available css in the app to see if there is
        something they can reuse. Who has time to read thousands of lines of code before they start
        working!? Even if people do have the time, I have not found that this is their first
        instinct on how to get going. I don’t blame them.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Even if you did read all of the available css and stumbled upon some code that you think
        might be reusable - what if someone edits it later? If you are starting from the assumption
        that your css isn't reusable, your first instinct is to write new css. But most likely you
        aren't creating a new classification of visual styles. In my experience it is likely that
        you are replicating visual styles that already exist.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Salesforce may pay people a lot of money. And they may win Forbes awards for being the most
        innovative. But they are not known for hiring people who are great at css. Their css is
        anything but innovative. After reading all of the css and going through bits of crying,
        head-scratching, and laughing out loud - I determined that this problem must only exist at
        Salesforce. Surely awesome companies like Medium, GitHub, Adobe, and Pinterest didn’t have
        this problem. They’ve hired some of the most amazing css developers I’ve ever met. They must
        have figured out how to scale css.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Naturally I opened up their sites and started to read their css too. Line by line. From
        start to finish. I wanted to see what everyone’s reality really was.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        I found the exact same things.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Let’s take a look at just the rulesets that set things to display none:
      </p>

      <ul class="list lh-copy pl0 mt0">
        <li>
          <a class="f5 f4-ns link underline dim black-80"
            href="https://gist.github.com/mrmrs/786241f0a5fade0324e2"
            title="GitHub">GitHub</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a class="f5 f4-ns link underline dim black-80"
            href="https://gist.github.com/mrmrs/57705f9a9fdce4d3d6f7"
            title="Pinterest">Pinterest</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a class="f5 f4-ns link underline dim black-80"
            href="https://gist.github.com/mrmrs/07e2ad668bac33e2da67"
            title="Medium">Medium</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a class="f5 f4-ns link underline dim black-80"
            href="https://gist.github.com/mrmrs/2d5592826adb45748bac"
            title="Adobe">Adobe</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        That’s a lot of code setting things to display: none. If you look at the files above ask
        yourself some questions: Do they seem like they follow the principles behind <abbr
        title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>? Does this seem like a bunch of code you would know
        how to reuse?
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        If I’m going to write css, I want it to be reusable. If someone isn’t going to reuse it - it
        seems pretty useless.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        So what does <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> even mean? Because you do have
        to repeat yourself somewhere! You either repeat yourself in html or in css. But no matter
        how good you are at css - you can’t build out a new component without editing html. But, it
        is possible to build a new component without writing a single line of css. And this applies
        to changing UI too. You should be able to change most things, just by editing html.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        When you repeat yourself in html, there isn’t any real damage to file size (read:
        multi-class patterns will not bloat your html). A user doesn’t have to download every html
        file from your website to view one page. Yet most web sites are architected in a way that
        require you to download the css for the entire site when you try to view one page. This is a
        broken model.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        The files I referenced above are the result of css authors generating really long selectors
        that add a lot of weight to your cascade to do one or two things. And as time goes on there
        are more and more things in your cascade to override. So your selectors get longer and
        longer, your file sizes get bigger and bigger, and the amount of time you spend debugging
        css is going to go up and up and up.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        In this model, you will never stop writing css. Refactoring css is hard and time consuming.
        Deleting unused css is hard and time consuming. And more often than not - it’s not work
        people are excited to do. So what happens? People keep writing more and more css.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        This affects scalability in two ways. One, it makes it harder to work on your app because
        you can't realistically memorize all of the css in your app. And if it isn't internalized it
        isn't likely to be reused. It also means that your users have an increasing amount of code
        to download. And if you think “oh but it will never get that bad, gzip will save the day” -
        well you’re wrong. Pinterest has more than 1mb of uncompressed css spread out over 5 files.
        Once gzipped it is still a whopping 159kb. <b>That is a lot of css</b>. 97% of it isn’t used
        on the homepage. I’d rather just try and send my users the 3% they do need.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Part of this code bloat is an attachment to authoring ‘content-semantic’ class names.
        Honestly I’m surprised you can find people that still think this isn’t the worst idea ever.
        <a class="link dim underline black-80"
          href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/">
          Nicolas Gallagher already wrote the mic drop piece on why this doesn’t work.</a> But for
        some reason you still find people arguing for its merits as a silver bullet solution.
        Personally I think most of the internet is unnecessarily broken. So I assume everything we
        have been taught is most likely wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        This is where we come to the crux of the problem I have with any system that requires you to
        map visual styles to components in your css. Content semantics have <b
        class="override-sans-serif fw7 ttu tracked">nothing to do with visual styles</b>. When I
        used to build things with Legos I never thought ‘oh this is a piece for an engine block’ I
        thought ‘oh cool this is a 1x4 blue lego and I can do anything I want with it’. It didn't
        matter if I was building an underwater aquanauts base or an airplane - I knew exactly how to
        use that lego block.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        It’s all about lego bits. Because I never needed to re-contextualize my understanding of
        lego blocks. I could use them across ‘projects’ and they were always the same. I dream of
        this world in front-end development. I want lego blocks that work everywhere because there
        is serious power in leveraging solutions that are project agnostic.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Outside of some brand specific background-images, gradients, and colors etc., the
        overwhelming majority of css you would need for your site has already been written. Yet we
        continue as a community to constantly reinvent the wheel. Which is starting to feel like
        building a camera from scratch every time you want to take a photo. I totally think building
        cameras from scratch is cool and a worthwhile endeavor. But I don’t want to do it every time
        I am going to take a photo. I just want to go take photos.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        When I read about or listen to ideas on how to scale an app’s css - most of the talk is
        about how to write css. The real way to scale css, is to stop writing css. Abstract out the
        things you use most and move to a multi-class pattern where you compose visual patterns in
        your html. You might be amazed at how quickly your team starts to move.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        There are a lot of problems that come along with people writing css. Inconsistent values,
        the introduction of magic numbers, duplicate code, non-responsive patterns. I’m sure there
        are others.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        If you create a system that is flexible and powerful, and pull from that, you might find
        your designs to be more harmonious. You might spend less time debugging the cascade. Your
        pages will probably load faster. But who knows. Maybe that won’t work for you at all. All I
        know is the current model is definitely not going to work.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Writing new css should be the exception, not the rule.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f3">Parting Thoughts</h3>

      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        If you have never read your outputted css from start to finish - I recommend it as an
        amazing way to learn a lot about css and how people use it. After I read salesforce’s css I
        started reading css in entirety for many sites. I still do this! I learn something new every
        time.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80 mv3 mv4-ns">
        Don’t take this as dogma. The real point of this whole piece is to encourage you to go test
        your assumptions. Not many people sit with other people building UI and just *observe* how
        they build out new features or refactor old ones. User-testing is such a great exercise to
        learn about how people use things. You can learn a lot from people who are great at writing
        front-end code and also people who are brand new to it. I wouldn’t have learned much of this
        if I just sat around and tried to solve problems by myself or read all the latest hip blog
        posts. The reality is lots of people with varying levels of agency will touch your front-end
        code and you should design a system that works for everyone.
      </p>
